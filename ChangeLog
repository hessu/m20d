Tue Jan  7 14:54:42 EET 2003	hessu
	- support for socket-type devices
	- retry opening connection to module

	- message IDs
	- version 2.0.0

Fri Jan 10 16:20:39 EET 2003	hessu
	- removed BSD-specific stuff (scandir & some headers) so that
	  we can compile in a POSIX.1 environment without including
	  a BSD compatibility environment which breaks other stuff...
	  => Solaris 2.6, 2.8 compiles are ok again.
	- longer timeout & better logging at SIM PIN insertion
	- version 2.0.1

Tue Jan 14 22:11:28 EET 2003	hessu
	- made help text more readable, added missing options
	- added configurable log destination
	- added configurable poll time
	- added mo retry logic (messages queued IN-CORE ONLY)

	- some more comments in the code
	- catch SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, made USR1 log stats
	- catch SIGTERM and shut down cleanly after finishing a loop
	- small change to make it work with Siemens M20 again, in addition
	  to the current target platform Siemens TC35
	- version 2.0.2

Wed Jan 15 14:00:48 EET 2003	hessu
	- fixed logging to syslog selection on command line
	- made the code a bit more modular
	- with -r (trace module traffic), flush stdout after every write
	  to have it in sync with the log lines which go through stderr
	  and are synced after every write.
	- version 2.0.3

Mon Jan 27 18:42:59 EET 2003	hessu
	- solaris warning-free compilation
	- empty_read_buffer() does not exit() any more if the connection
	  to the module fails (I/O error), returns -2 instead.
	- attempt to make simultaenous MO/MT traffic stable
	- version 2.0.4

Fri Jan 31 14:11:22 EET 2003	hessu
	- option -x <pidfile> to write a pid file
	- more complete DCS parsing to handle more ways of message class
	  and alphabet type indication
	- tunable MO retry logic
	- version 2.0.5

Thu Feb 13 10:48:35 EET 2003	hessu
	- write pid file _after_ forking. bummer.
	- reorder some code
	- modularize hex->binary and binary 7 bit default text -> ascii
	  conversion code
	- better TON/NPI parsing on MT, handle alphanumeric source addrs
	- attempt to handle unsolicited MT deliveries while executing
	  commands and sending MO
	- only handle one MO message from the spool per loop, then wait
	  for incoming messages for the poll interval.
	- version 2.0.6

Fri Feb 14 13:24:12 EET 2003	hessu
	- fixed SEGV bugs in some log messages in DCS parsing
	- move some TON/NPI parsing code in message.[ch]
	- better TON/NPI encoding for MO PDU generation
	- disable unsolicited SMS message transmission from module when
	  shutting down
	- version 2.0.7

Tue Apr 22 10:48:10 EEST 2003	hessu
	- escape text message contents in the logs
	- write MT spool file to a temporary name (.mt.tmp), then rename to
	  .mt before running the handler, to prevent race conditions.
	- delete MT messages from SIM after reading them from CMGL (did not
	  do this before!!)
	- really, really disable unsolicited SMS message transmission from
	  module when shutting down (do it _before_ closing the socket/serial
	  port 8-).
	- poll all (not just new) MT messages from SIM, so that everything
	  will get read and deleted. When running this version for the first
	  time, a bunch of old messages might be re-read and re-handled.
	- version 2.0.8

Thu Apr 24 12:51:37 EEST 2003	hessu
	- keep track of program state:
		"DOWN/UNDEFINED",
		"DOWN/INIT",
		"DOWN/CONNECTING",
		"DOWN/HANDSHAKING",
		"DOWN/NONETWORK",
		"DOWN/RETRYSLEEP",
		"DOWN/SHUTTINGDOWN",
		"DOWN/SHUTDOWN",
		"DOWN/FAILQUIT",
		"UP/SLEEPING",
		"UP/SENDING_MO",
		"UP/POLLING"
	- write state information <spooldir>/state.<logname> whenever state
	  changes (at least every polling information)
	- poll network information (network name, signal level/channel, etc)
	  and write to state file
	- enable unsolicited MT SMS message indications on every poll interval
	  if connected to a GSM network
	- version 2.1.0

Tue Apr 29 13:17:12 EEST 2003	hessu
	- write state files with permissions S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP|S_IROTH,
	  and spool files with S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR|S_IRGRP
	- parse even-length alphanumeric sender addresses properly, including
	  the last character
	- version 2.1.1

Tue Apr 29 13:43:52 EEST 2003	hessu
	- removed unnecessary error logging with alphanumeric odd-length
	  sender addresses
	- 'solaris' target for compiling on 2.6 & 2.8: 'make solaris'
	- version 2.1.2

Mon May  5 15:40:46 EEST 2003	hessu
	- add serial port speed configuration using parameter -b, supports
	  speeds from 300 to 115200 (57600/76800/115200 only on platforms
	  which support them).
	- make network information / network states work with a M20 module
	- version 2.1.3

Wed Aug 11 17:49:29 EEST 2004	hessu
	- fixed fd leak in TCP socket code, close the socket if
	  connect() fails.
	- if the modules has the required PIN codes but is not attempting
	  network registration (CREG: 1,0), send AT+COPS=2 to disable
	  network registration (actually does deregistration), and then
	  AT+COPS=0 to enable it again
	- fixed a typo in logging (s/discarder/discarded/)
	- version 2.1.4

Thu Aug 12 10:49:26 EEST 2004	hessu
	- sometimes m20d quits with the following errors:
	  ERR: Module responded with an ERROR for AT+CMGL
	  ERR: [init] Error response to AT+CSMS=1
	  made the following changes to (hopefully) get around this:
	- after AT+CMGL fails, sleep before attempting wait_registration().
	- in wait_registration(), AT+CSMS=1 is the fourth command issued,
	  and the previous commands do not fail. Log bug ignore the result
	  if this one fails.
	- If wait_registration() fails after AT+CMGL fails, only quit if the
	  return code indicates the PIN insertion failed. Otherwise,
	  sleep and reconnect to the module.
	- version 2.1.5

Thu Nov 22 14:41:55 EET 2007	hessu
	- clean compiling with gcc 4.2
	- version 2.1.6
